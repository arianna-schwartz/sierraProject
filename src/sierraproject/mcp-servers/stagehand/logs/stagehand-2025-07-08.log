After a previous appointment resulted in a botched highlight job, Felix, the store manager, stepped in and helped correct the color. I appreciated his professionalism and trusted him enough to continue booking appointments—specifically working around his availability to ensure my hair would be handled correctly and without further damage. However, at my most recent appointment, I was surprised and disappointed to find that ••••••• was not in the store. Had I known this in advance, I would have either rescheduled or canceled the appointment altogether. The only reason I maintained my membership was because ••• assured me that he would personally take care of my hair going forward. I believe in the importance of keeping one’s word, especially when it involves trust and personal appearance. I hope this issue can be addressed and resolved in a way that reflects the level of service I initially experienced with Felix. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

After a previous appointment resulted in a botched highlight job, Felix, the store manager, stepped in and helped correct the color. I appreciated his professionalism and trusted him enough to continue booking appointments—specifically working around his availability to ensure my hair would be handled correctly and without further damage. However, at my most recent appointment, I was surprised and disappointed to find that ••••••• was not in the store. Had I known this in advance, I would have either rescheduled or canceled the appointment altogether. The only reason I maintained my membership was because ••• assured me that he would personally take care of my hair going forward. I believe in the importance of keeping one’s word, especially when it involves trust and personal appearance. I hope this issue can be addressed and resolved in a way that reflects the level of service I initially experienced with Felix. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.
