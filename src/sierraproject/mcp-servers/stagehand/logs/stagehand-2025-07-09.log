My hair is naturally dark brown and grey. With both colors-I’m having the issue of the color washing out. I wait 3-4 days after coloring to wash my hair, and typically wash my hair every 3-4 days. Each time I wash color is transferring to my towel and my hair is slowly getting lighter. I can’t use the provided shampoo & conditioner bc I seem to have an allergy to it. The shampoo & conditioner I use is safe for color treated hair as well. How do I get the color to stop coming out with each wash?!
