Unfortunately, I did not mean to purchase the Daily Moisture Shampoo + Conditioner Set or the Pro Boost: Variety 4-Pack. I attempted to cancel these items before the order was processed, but was unable to do so through the system. I also want to confirm that I do not wish to be subscribed to or auto-delivered these items in the future. I will be returning the unwanted products and kindly request a refund for the shampoo/conditioner set and the Pro Boost 4-pack. Please let me know the next steps for returning the items and receiving the refund. Thank you for your assistance, and I appreciate your understanding.

Unfortunately, I did not mean to purchase the Daily Moisture Shampoo + Conditioner Set or the Pro Boost: Variety 4-Pack. I attempted to cancel these items before the order was processed, but was unable to do so through the system. I also want to confirm that I do not wish to be subscribed to or auto-delivered these items in the future. I will be returning the unwanted products and kindly request a refund for the shampoo/conditioner set and the Pro Boost 4-pack. Please let me know the next steps for returning the items and receiving the refund. Thank you for your assistance, and I appreciate your understanding.
